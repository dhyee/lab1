	<p>Donna is a 4th year Computer Science major currently attending UCSD. She recently studied abroad in South Korea during the Fall 2015 semester and she enjoyed it very much. It was one of the best decisions of her life. Now she is back in America and has experienced reverse culture shock. It will be awhile until she can fully adjust back to when she once was. </p>
